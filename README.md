# LaTeX-Template-ORU
A LaTeX template design and inspired by the LaTeX template at MDH. This is a constantly changing and improving version mainly created by Mikael Andersson, but this version is maintained by me (LIL_NAZ).


# Information
Please look at the readMe.txt (for now will eventually move it over to the README.md with nicer formatting), it is just a LaTeX report with biblio for bibliography (the template uses APA as its referencing system)
