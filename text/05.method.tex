% In this section you will describe what scientific methods you have used and how you have approached the work itself. For each goal above, you identify a method for achieving the goal. The choice of method must be justified. For example, you may have done a mathematical model, used simulations, done an implementation that you have tested or done an experiment that you might have evaluated using statistical methods. We intend here primarily to describe the scientific methods you have used, but it is also good if you give a description of how you worked on the task. The Method section also answers why you did it a certain way or why you used a certain tool. You should therefore not only describe "what" but also "why". Ask yourself the question: can the chosen method help me reach the set goals and thus answer the research question?

% Choosing the right scientific method(s) is important for you to reach your goals, therefore this is a point that you should discuss with your supervisor at an early stage. Also, look in the literature for good descriptions of methods, and how to best write a Method section.

\section{Method}
This section will explain how you are going to solve your problem. This section should explain what other method used and how they will be used  for example literature study, experimentation method and so on. A diagram explain the process is always good especially if it is an imitative process
