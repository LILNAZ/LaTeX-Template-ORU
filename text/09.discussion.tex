% Here you present an interpretation of the results and assess their significance. Discuss the possible consequences of the results and present any recommendations. It is important that you report on whether you have achieved the goals you set and thus answered your research question and achieved the purpose/aim of the work. The section should also contain reflections on the work, such as its limitations. You can also discuss solutions to problems that you have identified and discussed previously or address other problems that the work has not addressed, questions that have not been answered. Also link your results to previous work. This way the discussion can become a conversation with what you wrote in previous sections. Finally, put your own work into a wider context, broaden your perspective. Can your results be generalized? Can what you have done be used in some other context?
