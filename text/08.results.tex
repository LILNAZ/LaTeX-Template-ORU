% Here you can, for example, present results of experiments, evidence, analysis of data etc. Your results must be described so clearly that a reader can judge them. You should also explain and analyse the results.
\section{Results}

This section will present any results and explain the significant of the results, i.e. if something looks odd or something is normal and a bit why.

Example of how results should be presented. The results of the latency experiment gave an average latency of 0.4ms. The results can be seen in Figure \ref{CiscoLat}. The graph has a function of latency in milliseconds over the number of samples, depicted in its y- and x-axis, respectively. The results from the latency experiment gave a few numbers of spikes with an otherwise relatively consistent graph. A small number of spikes are normal behaviour on real networking equipment.
